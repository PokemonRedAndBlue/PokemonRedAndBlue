## Sprint 3 Progress Summary

### Initial Goals (Per Person)
Our original Sprint 4 objectives were divided as follows:
- **Danial** – Pokemon and Game data handling 
- **Arnav** – Multiple Map integration, Position preservation, Trainer Refactor
- **Wyatt** – Scene Handling and Pokemon States
- **Harshith** - Backlogged Items, Overall Support
- **Kevin** – Pokeball Animations and Sound effects/Music
- **Kai** – Tile based Colision and Map Movement, Player Refactor

### What Slipped Through the Cracks
While we made solid progress overall, a few planned features and design elements were delayed or re-scoped for Sprint 5:

- UI took much much longer than expected, so a more robust version of battle will come in sprint 5. But we do believe we have a strong foundation for that.
- Sound integration: this could have been added but this project is due in 20 minutes from me typing so it wont be. But we do not expect this to take very long since the heavy lifting is over.
- Complete UI for trainer and wild, theyre all very close but small things like item inventory and attack selection is not added just yet.
- Gym leader: we want to makew the gym leader special and within the time constraints this did not happen, we think that in sprint 5 we can give it more attention and have some fun with it.
- Title Screen, not an explicit expectation but would have been a nice touch.

### Notes
All incomplete tasks have been verified as functional in isolation and will be prioritized in **Sprint 5** for full integration.
Additionally Jira has been updated with backlogged and future plans for Sprint 5.
