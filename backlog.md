## Sprint 3 Progress Summary

### Initial Goals (Per Person)
Our original Sprint 3 objectives were divided as follows:
- **Danial** – Pokemon randomizer, Pokemon and Game data handling 
- **Arnav** – Tile Map, route construction
- **Wyatt** – Scene Handling and Pokemon States
- **Harshith** - Backlogged Items
- **Kevin** – Collision
- **Kai** – Player Camera
---

### What Slipped Through the Cracks
While we made solid progress overall, a few planned features and design elements were delayed or re-scoped for Sprint 4:

- We did not get collsion to be fully tile based, so there are some bugs where the player stops before it reaches an object physcially
- We still do not have game data handled in the most efficent or central way, things remain scattered
- Overall we did mostly all that we planned!

### Notes
All incomplete tasks have been verified as functional in isolation and will be prioritized in **Sprint 4** for full integration.
Additionally Jira has been updated with backlogged and future plans for Sprint 4.
