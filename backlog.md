## Sprint 2 Progress Summary

### Initial Goals (Per Person)
Our original Sprint 2 objectives were divided as follows:
- **Danial** – Player character movement  
- **Arnav** – Tiles, grass, buildings, and trees  
- **Wyatt & Harshith** – Pokémon sprites and their small animations  
- **Kevin** – Poké Ball sprites (shake and opening animations)  
- **Kai** – Trainer encounter logic (player stops when approached by trainer)

### What Slipped Through the Cracks
While we made solid progress overall, a few planned features and design elements were delayed or re-scoped for Sprint 3:

- We **did not plan or implement the Command Design Pattern** early on, so refactoring for this pattern will move to Sprint 3.  
- **Movement and controls** were not abstracted as initially intended (related to the Command Pattern implementation).  
- **Trees and buildings** were not added — only basic tiles were completed.  
- The **hurt, attack, and damage animations** for both front and back Pokémon views were coded and tested successfully,  
  but we **did not have time to integrate them into the main game file** for display.

### Notes
All incomplete tasks have been verified as functional in isolation and will be prioritized in **Sprint 3** for full integration.
